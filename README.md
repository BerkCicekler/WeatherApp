# 🌥 Weather App ☁️
This is a Weather application without a back-end currently. I coded this project in order to learn more about the SwiftUI development. <br> 
Also I have to mention, that this project is actually development by DesignCode and its given us as a tutorial in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8sP7AS0CAY) video. <br>
Since this tutorial is almost 3 years old, I had to implement new features of XCode 16 / IOS 18.   

## 🚩 Plans 
- [X] Complete UI
- [ ] Get weather forecast of user's current location
- [ ] Allow searching weather forecast of the cities
